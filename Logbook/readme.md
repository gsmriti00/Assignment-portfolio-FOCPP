Python Programming Logbook Summary (Weeks 1–8)


This logbook contains all the exercises from Weeks 1 to 8, showing my learning and practice in Python programming. It includes working with variables, data types, operators, conditionals, loops, and functions to perform calculations, control program flow, and organize code. I have also learned to create and run scripts, use modules and imports, and handle command-line arguments.

The logbook covers working with different data structures like lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries, including methods to access, modify, and iterate through them. It also includes exercises on input/output and file handling, such as reading and writing files safely and formatting output using f-strings and .format().

Overall, this logbook shows how I can write Python programs, solve problems, and use the language effectively in a practical and structured way.
