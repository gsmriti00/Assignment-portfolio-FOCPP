Objective:

The goal of this lab was to practice basic Python concepts like arithmetic, variables, data types, strings, lists, and user input.


What I Did:

I started with expressions and operator precedence, experimenting with arithmetic operators and parentheses to see how calculations are evaluated. I explored variables, updated values using operators like += and *=, and calculated averages.

I learned about data types (int, float, str, bool) and used type() to check them. Using input(), I collected user data, performed calculations, and displayed results. I practiced strings, using escape sequences, triple quotes, and slicing to access or manipulate text.

I also worked with lists, creating, modifying, appending, and combining elements, as well as repeating and slicing lists. Examples included prime numbers and names lists with additions and updates.


Outcome:

This lab helped me understand how to work with variables, data types, strings, and lists in Python, handle user input, and perform basic operations, forming a strong foundation for further Python programming.
