Objective:

The purpose of this lab was to practice working with variables, different data types, string operations, user input, and lists in Python.


What I Did:

I started with variables and arithmetic operations, updating values with +=, -=, *=, and /= operators, and calculating averages. I explored data types using type() and practiced basic operations with booleans, integers, floats, and strings.

Next, I collected user input, greeted the user, calculated future ages, and multiplied numbers. I practiced strings and escape sequences, using single, double, and triple quotes, as well as special characters and tabs. I also explored indexing and slicing to access parts of strings safely.

Finally, I worked with lists, creating lists of numbers and names, adding new elements, combining lists, repeating elements, and slicing them to extract subsets. This included prime numbers and names lists with modifications.


Outcome:

By completing this lab, I understood how to manage variables, work with multiple data types, handle user input, manipulate strings, and use lists effectively in Python. This builds a solid foundation for more advanced Python programming.
