Objective:

The goal of this lab was to practice using boolean expressions, logical operators, membership testing, if-statements, ternary operators, and loops in Python.


What I Did:

I started by exploring boolean expressions using relational operators like <, >, !=, and >= with numbers, strings, and lists. I also tried mixed-type comparisons to see how Python handles them. Next, I worked with logical operators (and, or, not) and operator chaining to check multiple conditions in one statement.

I practiced membership testing using in and not in to check for values in lists and substrings in strings. Then I wrote several if-else statements to control program flow based on conditions, including multi-branch elif chains for age categories. I also explored non-boolean conditions, where Python treats non-zero or non-empty values as True. I applied the ternary operator for compact conditional expressions.

For iteration, I used while loops to perform countdowns and for loops to iterate over lists and ranges, including power calculations. I practiced loop control statements: break to stop a loop early and continue to skip iterations based on conditions. Finally, I calculated averages selectively, such as average passing grades, by combining loops and conditions.


Outcome:

This lab helped me understand how to use boolean logic, conditional statements, loops, and control flow effectively in Python. It strengthened my ability to evaluate conditions, iterate over data, and handle different cases in a program, forming a foundation for more complex programming tasks.
