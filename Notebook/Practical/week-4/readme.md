Objective:

The goal of this lab was to practice creating and using functions, handling parameters, exploring default and keyword arguments, and using lambda expressions to perform quick computations.


What I Did:

I began by importing modules like math to use built-in functions such as sqrt() and log2(). Then, I created basic functions, starting with displayTwice() to print messages multiple times and later added docstrings to understand documentation. I wrote functions like findMax() to return the larger of two values and multiply() to handle optional parameters, where a single argument squared the value.

I explored positional and keyword arguments using a function someFunc(), which allowed flexibility in how arguments are passed. I practiced custom printing using the sep parameter to format outputs neatly. To handle multiple inputs dynamically, I created calcAve() with variable arguments to calculate averages.

Lambda expressions were used to define small, anonymous functions quickly, such as hypot to compute the hypotenuse of a right triangle and to_seconds to convert hours and minutes to total seconds, with and without default values.

Finally, I organized key Python terms like Module, Standard Library, Parameters, and Lambda expressions into a dictionary to summarize important concepts from the lab.


Outcome:

This lab helped me understand how to write reusable functions, handle different types of arguments, use anonymous functions for small computations, and document code. I also learned to combine Python concepts like modules, math functions, and dictionaries effectively, which strengthens my programming foundation.
