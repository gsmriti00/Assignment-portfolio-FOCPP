Objective:

The goal of this lab was to practice handling user input, performing arithmetic and logical checks, working with functions, and using external modules to organize reusable code.


What I Did:

I started by asking the user to enter a number and converted it to an integer. Using simple if-else statements, I checked if the number was even or odd and whether it was divisible by 10.

Next, I created a function called average() to calculate the mean of a list of values, demonstrating how functions can accept input, perform calculations, and return results. I also added a docstring to explain the function’s purpose.

I explored command-line arguments using the sys module. By checking sys.argv, the program could sum and average numbers passed as arguments when running the script from a terminal.

Finally, I practiced modular programming by importing a custom module my_utils and using its average() function to calculate averages of different sets of numbers, demonstrating how to organize and reuse code across programs.


Outcome:

This lab helped me understand user input handling, conditional logic, writing functions with docstrings, working with command-line arguments, and importing custom modules. I also learned how modular programming improves code reuse and maintainability.
