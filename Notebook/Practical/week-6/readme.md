Objective:

The goal of this lab was to practice working with lists and tuples, including accessing elements, modifying lists, sorting, and performing operations like copying, appending, and slicing.


What I Did:

I started with a list of colors, learning how to find the index of an item, count occurrences, and copy lists to avoid modifying the original. I practiced adding elements using append(), extend(), and insert(). I also used list comprehensions to generate cubes of numbers from 2 to 20.

I explored sorting lists, both in the default order and with a custom key using a lambda function. I practiced removing items using pop() and remove(), and reversing a list with reverse(). I also computed square roots of list elements using the math.sqrt() function.

For tuples, I worked with an address tuple, demonstrating tuple unpacking to assign values to variables, and using the * operator to print all elements easily. This helped me understand how tuples are immutable but can store multiple heterogeneous values efficiently.


Outcome:

By completing this lab, I learned how to manipulate lists, generate values programmatically, handle duplicates, sort and reverse lists, and use tuples for structured data. These skills are fundamental for storing, processing, and managing collections of data in Python.
