Objective:

The aim of this lab was to practice using sets and dictionaries in Python for storing, organizing, and performing operations on data efficiently.


What I Did:

I started with sets, creating collections of unique elements and using set comprehensions to extract unique letters from a sentence. I practiced adding elements with update() and combining sets using union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference operations. I also checked relationships between sets using issubset() and issuperset() to confirm if one set is fully contained in another.

Next, I explored dictionaries, storing key-value pairs for items like stock quantities. I practiced adding new keys, accessing values, and removing items with popitem(). I also used dictionary comprehensions to generate a mapping of numbers to their square roots, demonstrating how dictionaries can store calculated values dynamically.


Outcome:

Through this lab, I learned how to handle unordered collections, perform membership tests, and efficiently manipulate structured data. Using sets helped me understand uniqueness and relationships, while dictionaries reinforced how to store and access key-value pairs dynamically in Python.
