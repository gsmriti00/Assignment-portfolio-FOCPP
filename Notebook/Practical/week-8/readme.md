Objective:

The goal of this lab was to practice formatted output using f-strings and str.format(), and to learn how to read, write, and manage files in Python.



What I Did:

I started with f-strings, calculating the area of a rectangle with floating-point numbers and controlling the number of decimal places. I also practiced text alignment, using left, right, center alignment, and fill characters to make outputs neatly formatted. I converted f-string formatting into str.format() to understand both approaches.

Next, I worked with files. I opened a file with open(), read all content, and also read line by line using readline() and loops. I practiced appending new content to the file and saw how using a with statement` automatically handles closing the file safely.



Outcome:

Through this lab, I learned how to produce clear, formatted output, control alignment and precision, and perform basic file operations like reading, writing, and appending. I also learned best practices for file handling, such as using with to ensure files are properly closed.
