Purpose

To verify a user’s password by checking its length and confirming specific characters for security.


Input Validation

The password must be at least 9 characters long.

User input is handled safely to avoid errors when checking character positions.


Description

The program asks the user to enter a password and first checks if it meets the minimum length requirement. If the password is too short, the program stops immediately. The program then asks the user to enter letters from specific positions in the password. If all entered letters match the correct characters, the security check passes; otherwise, the program ends with a failure message.


Output

A password security heading

Messages indicating whether each letter is correct

A final message showing whether the security check passed or failed
